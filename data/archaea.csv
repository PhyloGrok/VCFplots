PRJEB64517,,,,,,,,"XCR1+ dendritic cells play an important role in limiting the immune response to members of the gut microbiota, preventing inflammation and maintaining gut homeostasis. Mice lacking XCR1+ cDCs have a proinflammatory gut environment and are prone to opportunistic infections by commensals. As chickens contain greater numbers of these cells in their guts than mammals, it is expected that they would also play a role in controlling gut inflammation. In this study the gut microbiota of wild-type (HET) and XCR1 knockout (HOM) chickens was characterised, with and without infectious bronchitis virus vaccination. DNA was extracted from caecal contents, sequenced via Illumina and Pacbio Hifi sequencing, and used to construct metagenome assembled genomes."

In previous studies, pf0739 has been proposed to be the copper-dependent regulator CopR in P. furiosus.</p><p>Here, we have characterised the metal-sensing transcriptional regulator CopR by describing the influence of different metal ions on the DNA-binding of wild-type and domain-depleted pf0739 mutants. To learn about the CopR-regulated gene network in P. furiosus, we performed differential gene expression analysis (DGE) and chromatin immunoprecipitation in combination with high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) under normal and 20 microM copper-shock conditions. By integrating the transcriptome and genome-wide binding data, we found that CopR binds to the upstream regions of many copper-induced genes. Activation of the exporting ATPase (PF0740) was confirmed using in vitro transcription assays and DNase I footprinting. Negative-stain transmission electron microscopy and image analysis by 2D class averaging revealed an octameric assembly formed from a tetramer of dimers similar to the published crystal structures from LrpA from P. furiosus and FFRP, an orthologue of Pyrococcus sp.
