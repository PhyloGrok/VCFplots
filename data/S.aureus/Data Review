<h1> Data Analysis </h1>

<p> The Virtual Contact File (VCF) was obtained from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Sequence Read Archives. 
The files retrieved were in FASTQ format, a widely used text-based format containing raw data of biological sequences. This format is 
essential as it includes both the nucleotide sequence and their corresponding quality score (the accuracy of each nucleotide in a biological sequence).
